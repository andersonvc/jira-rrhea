## Examples

### Basic

This example should cover 95% of use cases.

If you use `npm ci` or `yarn --frozen-lockfile` on CI to install NPM dependencies - this Action is for you. Simply use it, and your NPM modules will be installed and the folder `~/.npm` or `~/.cache/yarn` will be cached. Typical use:

```yml
name: main
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
      - run: npm t
```

See [bahmutov/npm-install-action-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install-action-example) ![npm-install-action-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install-action-example/workflows/main/badge.svg?branch=master).

### Subfolders

If your repository contains packages in separate folders, install each one separately

```text
repo/
  app1/
    package-lock.json
  app2/
    yarn.json
```

```yml
name: main
on: [push]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
        with:
          working-directory: app1
      - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
        with:
          working-directory: app2

      - name: App1 tests
        run: npm t
        working-directory: app1
      - name: Run app2
        run: node .
        working-directory: app2
```

See [npm-install-monorepo-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install-monorepo-example) ![npm-install-monorepo-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install-monorepo-example/workflows/main/badge.svg?branch=master).

You can also specify multiple subfolders in a single action; one subfolder per line.

```yml
name: main
on: [push]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
        with:
          working-directory: |
            app1
            app2
```

### Use lock file

By default, this action will use a lock file like `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`. You can set `useLockFile: false` to use just `package.json` which might be better for [building libraries](https://twitter.com/mikeal/status/1202298796274700288).

```yml
- uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
  with:
    useLockFile: false
```

## NPM

If you are writing your own GitHub Action and would like to use this action as a utility function, import it and run it.

```js
const { npmInstallAction } = require('npm-install')
await npmInstallAction()
```

## Debugging

You can see verbose messages from GitHub Actions by setting the following secrets (from [Debugging Actions Guide](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-debugging.md#step-debug-logs))

```
ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

**Tip:** environment variable `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` enables debug messages from this action itself, try it first.

## Testing

Using Mocha and Sinon.js following the guide [How to set up Mocha with Sinon.js](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/mocha-and-sinon/). You can find the tests in [test](test) folder. In general:

- all environment inputs are done inside the action, so they can be stubbed and controlled during tests
- there are separate workflows in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) that match examples. Each workflow uses this action to install dependencies
